Synth is a web application that allows you to stream audio and find new tracks. Synth allows you to make playlists and look for songs, artists, albums, or playlists. You can also explore artist and album pages, as well as listen to top tracks by an artist. The music player allows you to manage core functions like play/pause, continue, and volume control, as well as view song information like artist, album, and song length.

## Production Builds

We have setup the following domains for our backend & frontend code using Vercel. They communicate with each other. Both prod builds are created of 'master' branches of the respective submodule repos mentioned above.

Main Website - [https://synth-music.vercel.app/](https://synth-music.vercel.app/)
<br/>
Backend - [https://synth-backend.vercel.app/api/](https://synth-backend.vercel.app/api/)

All our prod build use the below redis cloud credentials.
<br/>
DB alias - redis-13481.c281.us-east-1-2.ec2.cloud.redislabs.com:13481
<br/>
Username - default
<br/>
Password - UcmL3LN30VRZ2LMZJKXngs9akGf57C2f

## Staging Builds

We have setup the following staging environment for our backend & frontend code using Vercel to test our code. Both staging builds are created of 'dev' branches ONLY.

Main Website - [https://synth-frontend-git-dev-namz11.vercel.app/](https://synth-frontend-git-dev-namz11.vercel.app/)
<br/>
Backend - [https://synth-backend-git-dev-namz11.vercel.app/](https://synth-backend-git-dev-namz11.vercel.app/)

## Limitations

We are using the spotify api which limits the number of devices playing music simultaneously to only one. So irrespective of the user logged in at a time only one person can play music on one device.
<br/>
The datepicker gives some tota11y issues.
